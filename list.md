## TECH STUFF THAT I LIKE & WANT TO LEARN!

- I'm highly interested in learning about the **Linux system** (the deep rabbit holes). Currently, I'm using this *[https://www.opsschool.org/](https://www.opsschool.org/)* as a reference for what all I have to learn.

- Next is **Computer Networking** concepts. The day job helps here & I'm learning at a personal level too. For example, recently, I've started learning about how DNS resolver is implemented. I want to do projects around it, mostly implementing these tools at a very basic level to build a better fundamental understanding around them.

- **Writing better code**. The intent is to start writing code all by myself to a good extend. For background, I have written code in many programming languages but the maximum of it is with help from the internet.
    1. `Java` for Desktop application|Client-Server Socket-Programming (long back), 
    2. Basic `C++` during graduation,
    3. `Python` for Automation-scripts/templates, websites, basic games, IRC bots(socket-programming), simple ML algorithms, Computer-Vision. Even Python is the primary programming language.
    4. `C` (with GTK+ GUI Toolkit) while contributing to project gtranslator under GNOME Foundation.
    5. `Javascript` for scripting, web-dev, browser phaser.js games
    6. Have just started with `Go`. So far, have tried implementing containers from scratch, basic REST APIs, basic web-servers.

I've exposure with many, but I'm not really confident in any of them. So, now I want to extend it to a level, that I can be a little more confident while writing code all by own-self as well. The current job doesn't provide me much opportunity to write actual code (other than the automation scripts & YAML templates), so, I'm lagging here.

- **Containerization tools & Security**. Currently, I'm reading this book, *Container Security* by Liz Rice. 

- And finally, **DevOps & Cloud-computing** is what I want to pursue in the long term. But I do want to keep writing actual code as well!


## THINGS I LIKE ABOUT WORK ENVIRONMENTS | COMMUNITIES

### Current Job:

- I love the challenges provided almost every single day. The product is new, trying to evolve, so there are a ton of opportunities to learn & explore new tools, implement new concepts & kinds of stuff.

### Open Source Communities (#dgplug, #learnandteach on freenode server):

- I've genuinely started my streamlined technical learning from the community [dgplug](https://dgplug.org/) itself. I respect the values, I'm really grateful to the fact that nobody sets a bar for you to learn & work with people here. Rather they profusely help to proceed in the right direction!

- The minority and underrepresented issues are considered and respected. I feel more confident while sharing my thoughts & learnings in the community, rather at work.

- These communities are my space to learn, explore, share, discuss, and implement almost everything, with no strings attached. And yet, the opinions & thoughts are *always* respect.

- The Outreachy internship helped me to regain confidence. I interviewed a lot during the last month of my internship & I literally ended up having multiple job offers before I ended with the Outreachy internship period. I consider Outreachy a life-changing milestone.

- Lots of folks approached me for help after this. So, I got this chance to talk to a lot of them, help them with my best, and many of them came back to share their accomplishments and gratitude. This is the biggest achievement. :)

- I got mentors from the community!
