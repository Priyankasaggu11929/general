## Working with Command Line using Python! 

> The command line is where the rubber hits the road. 

The session will broadly talk about how to interact with systems and shell environments from within Python. Further expanding to writing command line tools using Python, from (almost) scratch to building them using feature-loaded Python modules.

The following is the outline around topics to be covered during the talk:

 - Working with the Shell
    - Talking to the Interpreter with the `sys` module.
    - Dealing with the Operating System using the `os` module.
    - Spawn processes with the `subprocess` module.
 - Basic introduction to Python *function decorators* & *Classes*.
 - Creating Command-Line Tools
    - Using `sys.argv`.
    - Using `argparse`.
    - Using `click`.
    - Using `fire`.
    - And finally, implementing Plug-ins.
